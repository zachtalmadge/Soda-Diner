# Soda Diner

This is an application that contains collections of various <b>diners</b> and <b>sodas</b>. Each diner will serve many different kinds of sodas which the app will display when a user navigates to the page for that diner.


## Overview

This might have been one of my favorite projects thus far. I actually had to start over 3 times before I got things right. But once I did it was one of the most rewarding experiences I've had in this class. Building out the front-end UI was a blast and I truly got to know Mongoose/MongoDB along the way. 

My favorite feature is the sodaColor() function I wrote in the home.js file. It uses a switch statement to automatically apply a color class to a newly created soda. Semantic UI was what made this so easy to code out. Special shout out to backticks and string interpolation for making this all possible! View the function at the bottom of ./public/js/home.js to see what sodas were covered.

## -----> ***Disclaimer*** <-----
If you experience any bugs (i.e. buttons do not respond, effects are not firing, app allows creation of duplicates, etc.) refresh the web page. If that doesn't work restart the MongoDB engine, drop both Soda / Diner collections from the database, restart the server and load the page.

## Acknowledgment
Thank you to The Last Mile for providing me with the education, tools and resources to learn WDF and MERN. This has been an amazing journey from day 1. Imposter syndrome hit me really hard at the beginning of this project because as I mentioned earlier I had to restart from scratch 3 times but I pushed on through. Having made it to the other side of this I have more confidence in myself than ever before.
